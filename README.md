# Keras Tensorflow Model deployed for Inference in Kafka Streams / KSQL microservice via Deeplearning4j

This project deploys a Neural Network trained with Keras and TensorFlow to a Kafka Streams / KSQL microservice for real time predictions. As TensorFlow's Java API is still not a stable release, this project leverages Deeplearning4j (DL4J) which supports import of Keras models already.
 
## Use Case / Architecture
TODO


## Source Code
TODO Unit Test with Java / Kafka Streams + DL4J
TODO KSQL UDF embedding the model via DL4J

## How to run it?

### Requirements
- Java 8
- [Confluent Platform 5.0+](https://www.confluent.io/download/) (Confluent Enterprise if you want to use the Confluent MQTT Proxy, Confluent Open Source if you just want to run the KSQL UDF and send data via kafkacat instead of MQTT)
- TODO

### Step-by-step demo
